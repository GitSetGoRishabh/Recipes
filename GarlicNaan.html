    <p>This Garlic Naan bread is light, soft, fresh, and filled with flavor! It is so good that you will be making it again and again. I show you how to make Garlic Naan on a skillet on a stovetop. In my recipe the dough is infused with fresh garlic making it extra delicious. Serve the Restaurant Style Garlic Naan Bread as a side for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
