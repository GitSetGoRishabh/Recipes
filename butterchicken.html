    <br>
    <p>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) is a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced Indian curry featuring marinated chicken pieces simmered in a velvety tomato, butter, and cream sauce, characterized by its vibrant color and balance of sweet, tangy, and savory flavors from ingredients like ginger, garlic, garam masala, and the signature kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). A typical recipe involves marinating chicken in yogurt and spices, cooking it (often grilled or pan-fried), then simmering it in a base of butter, tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and cream with whole spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon for depth, finishing with fresh cream and kasuri methi. </p>
